I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Materials Science from TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany. I'm mostly excited about the infusion of ever-evolving programming paradigms into engineering disciplines related to Mechanical engineering. Currently, I'm learning to code in Python, C++, and MATLAB. This is a collection of my work that I'm allowed to share.
